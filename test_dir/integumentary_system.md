;;the skin;;
::
both an organ system and an organ in itself, composed on many parts that serve
vital functions to the body.
::

# Layers of the skin

## ;;Epidermis;;

::
outermost layer of skin, composed mainly of stratified squamous epithelial tissue
    - avascular
::

### ;;layers of the epidermis;;

::
going from deepest to outermost:
    - first layer of epidermis is {{stratum basale}}
    - second layer of epidermis is {{stratum spinosum}}
    - third layer of epidermis is {{stratum granulosum}}
    - fourth layer of epidermis is {{stratum lucidum}}
    - fifth layer of epidermis is {{stratum corneum}}
::

;;stratum basale;;
::
Deepest epidermal layer.
    - attaches epidermis to the basal lamina, below which lies the dermis layers
    - single layer of basal cells
    - only layer that reproduces
    - existing cells are pushed superficially away from stratum basal toward the
      top
::
;;melanocyte;;
::
cell responsible for creating melanin and exporting them via melanosomes.
::

;;stratum spinosum;;
::
Second layer of epidermis
    - spiny appearance
    - keratinocytes here begin the synthesis of keratin and release glycolipids
      that prevent water loss.
    - composed of eight to 10 layers of keratinocytes.
    - the spiny appearance is an artifact of the staining process.
::

;;desmosome;;
::
Cell structure specialized for cell-to-cell adhesion.
Causes the spiny look of stratum spinosum.
::

;;stratum granulosum;;
::
Third layer of epidermis. grainy appearance.
    - three to five layers deep
    - cells generate large amounts of keratin and keratohyalin
    - cells begin to die and leave behind their keratin
::
;;keratohyalin;;
::
Granulated protein found in stratum granulosum.
::

;;stratum lucidum;;
::
Fourth layer of epidermis. Smooth, seemingly translucent layer just above
stratum granulosum.
    - thin layer of cells, found only on/visible only on the thick skin of
      palms, soles, and digits.
    - cells are now dead and flattened.
    - densely packed with eleiden
::
;;eleiden;;
::
Clear protein derived from keratohyalin which gives cells in the stratum lucidum
their transparent appearance.
    - serves as barrier to water.
::

;;Stratum corneum;;
::
Superficial most layer of the epidermis.
    - 15-30 layers of cells.
    - completely dead, keratinized, and flattened.
    - mechanical protection.
::

## ;;Dermis;;

::
Middle "core" of integumentary system.
    - contains blood and lymph vessels, nerves, hair follicles, and sweat
      glands.
::

### ;;Layers of the dermis;;

::
    - first layer of dermis is {{papillary layer}}
    - second layer of dermis is {{reticular layer}}
::

;;papillary layer;;
::
superficial layer of dermis composed of loose areolar connective tissue.
    - projects into the stratum basale to form dermal papillae
::
;;dermal papillae;;
::
extensions of papillary layer of dermis that increase surface contact between
epidermis and dermis
::

;;reticular layer;;
::
deep layer of dermis composed of dense irregular connective tissue.
    - well vascularized.
    - lots of nerves
    - tight meshwork of fibres.
::

## ;;Hypodermis;;

::
Layer directly below the dermis, connects the skin to underlying fascia of bones
and muscles.
    - not considered a part of the skin.
    - border between hypodermis and dermis can be difficult to distinguish.
    - composed of vascularized loose areolar connective tissue and adipose
      tissue.
(subcutaneous layer, superficial fascia)

- components

- layers of epidermis of the skin
    - epidermis
        - ~90% are keratinocytes
        - ~2% for nervous tissue and immune cells
        - keratinocyte
        - melanocyte
    - dermis
    - hypodermis

- epidermal derivatives functions

- five major functions

# Accessory structures of the skin

;;hair;;
::
keratinous filament growing out of the epidermis
::
;;follicle;;
::
cavity or sac from which hair originates
::

;;nails;;
::
specialized structure of epidermis that protects the tips of our fingers and
toes.
    - the nail body forms at the nail root which has a matrix of proliferating cells from the {{stratum basale}}
::

;;eccrine sweat gland;;
::
type of gland that produces hypotonic sweat for thermoregulation
::

;;apocrine sweat gland;;
::
sweat gland usually associated with hair follicles.
    - larger than apocrien sweat glands and lie deeper in the dermis.
    - produce, water, salts, and organic compounds.
::

;;sudoriferous glands;; ::sweat glands::

;;sebaceous glands;;
::
oil gland found all over the body, helps with lubricaiton and waterproofing of
skin and hair.
    - most are associated with hair follicles.
    - excrete sebum - a mixture of lipids.
::

# ;;Functions of integumentary system;;
::
    - first function of integumentary system is {{protection}}
    - second function of integumentary system is {{sensory function}}
    - third function of integumentary system is {{thermoregulation}}

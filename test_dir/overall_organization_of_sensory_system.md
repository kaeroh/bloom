;;sensory receptors;;
::
cells in the peripheral nervous system that respond to different types of stimuli
::

;;transduction;;
::
process of changing environmental signal into electrochemical signals that the
nervous system can read
::

# ;;structural receptor types;;

::
axis to divide receptor cells based on the structure of the cell itself
::
    - ;;free nerve ending receptor;;::structural receptor type where dendrites are embedded in tissue::
    - ;;encapsulated ending;;::structural receptor type where nerve endings are
      encapsulated in connective tissue that enhances sensitivity::
    - ;;specialized receptor;;::structural receptor type where they don't fit into either other two categories::

# ;;functional receptor types;;

::
axis to divide receptor cells based on how the receptor transduces stimuli.
    - physical vibrations
    - ions and macromolecules diffusion
    - electromagnetic radiation
::

# ;;Sensory modalities;;
::a system for interpreting and perceiving environmental stimuli, a specific
language/mode::

;;general and specific/special senses;;
::
general senses are distributed throughout the body--mechanoreceptors, proprioception.
special senses are localized to a specific organ--eyes, ear, tongue, nose
::

## ;;somatosensation;;
::group of sensory modalities associated with proprioception and interoception.
includes itch, temperature, pain, etc.::

    - ;;free nerve endings;;
        ::
        mechanoreceptor of somatosensation.
        located in dermis, cornea, visceral organs.
        detects pain, temperature, mechanical deformation
        ::
    - ;;Mechanoreceptors;;
        ::
        (Merkel's discs)
        mechanoreceptor of somatosensation
        located in 
        ::

## ;;gustation;;
::sensory modality dealing with taste::

;;papillae;;
::
(singular: papilla)
raised bumps containing structures for gustatory transduction on
the stratified squamous epithelium of the oral cavity
::

;;taste buds;;
::
buds within the papillae containing specialized gustatory receptor cells
{{gustatory receptor cells}} are cells sensitive to chemicals contained in ingested foods
::

gustatory receptor cells are activated by {{taste molecules}} through a {{change in membrane potential}}

;;gustatory sense information pathways;;
::
    - goes to thalamus to be projected into cerebrum
    - limbic system and hypothalamus for emotional reaction
    - medulla oblongata for the activation of reflexes involved with digestion
      like secretion of saliva and gastric juices
::

## ;;olfaction;;
::sensory modality to do with smell::

;;olfactory epithelium;;
::
wall of superior nasal cavity containing olfactory sensory neurons
::

;;olfactory sensory neuron structure and function;;
::
extends dendrites into apical surface of olfactory epithelium into the mucus
lining the cavity. Airborne molecules dissolve in the mucus and bind with
odorant molecules that keep them dissolved so they can bind to a receptor
protein within the cell membrane of an olfactory dendrite.
::

;;axons of olfactory sensory neurons;;
::
forms the olfactory nerve that extends from the basal surface of olfactory
epithelium into the brain through an opening in the skull
::

;;pathway of olfactory information;;
::
projected directly to primary olfactory cortex in temporal lobe.
Some project to structures in the limbic system for association with emotion and
memory.
::

;;olfactory tract;;
::
olfactory nerve formed from olfactory receptor axons contact this tract to be
brought directly into the brain.
::

## ;;audition and balance;;
:: sensory modality dealing with sound and balance::

### anatomy of ear

;;tympanic membrane;;
::
ear drum, the piece of tissue that vibrates with sound
waves
::

# ;;vision;;
::sensory modality dealing with the detection of electromagnetic radiation::

## anatomy of the eye

;;palpebral conjunctiva;;
::
membrane attached to the inner surface of the eyelids
that covers the anterior surface of the cornea.
::

;;lacrimal gland;;
::
beneath the lateral edges of the nose either side of the nose. 
Produces tears.
::

;;lacrimal duct;;
::
duct in the medial corner of the eye where tears are drained.
::

;;eye tunics;;
::
3 layers of tissue making up the eye.
::
    - ;;fibrous tunic;;
    ::
    most superficial layer of the eye.
    includes white sclera and clear cornea
